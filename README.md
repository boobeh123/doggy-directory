## Description
A web application is a static webpage that fetches a list of dog breeds, displays a random picture of that breed, and creates a unique name, likes, and dislikes.

## Demo

* Displays an image of the selected breed
* Displays a name and fun facts from a pre-generated list

## Optimizations
* Add a "generate random breed" button.
* ~Add better legibility to generated Facts & Hobbies~
From the prior list of optimizations, I completed one. I did add a few changes which enhances accessibility with screen readers, increases performance with pageload, and a more modern layout with updated component design.

## What did you learn?
* HTML: Drop down menu with select tag & option tags
* JavaScript: Fetching from API, createElement method, and Fisher Yates Shuffle 
* Git: Version control of a project start to finish
* Optimizations: Adding an `async` attribute to the `<script>` tag allows the script to load with the page rendering, improving page load time. Preloading my stylesheets and fonts download resources asap and helps with performance.

## Reflection
The Dog CEO API is easy to work with and great for beginner projects. It requires no authentication and a simple fetch is enough to start interacting with it.
